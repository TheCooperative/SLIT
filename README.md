When uploading something you've wrorked on, please make sure you are up to speed with the branch. When a piece of code is to be implemented in the project it will be uploaded to the **develop** brach, and further when a bigger part is finished it can be uploaded to the **master** branch.

- The **master** branch is only for final work.
- The **develop** branch is for joint work.



## Changing Branch
Note that it would be wise to save your progress before changing branch.
 - git checkout (branchname)


## Git add, commit and push
You can ether add files manually by placing them in the folder under the currect branch, or you can use commandline.
- git add (filename)
- git commit -m "Write comment"
- git push origin (branchname)


## Committing
When committing follow these guidelines:
- First explain what **action** you made
  - *Update, Add, Remove, Hotfix, Bugfix, Merge Conflict*
- Second the **filename** of the file you changed or the **merge conflict** you fixed
- Then a short **description** of what you did

Example: *git commit -m "Update - README - Added guidelines"*
